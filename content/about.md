A small, dense community — running sovereign infrastructure, governing its own data, verifying its own claims — can produce more genuine intellectual value than organizations a hundred times its size.

The Grove is built inside a former Catholic school in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The mechanism is old: complementary minds, a shared library, honest inquiry, enough time. What is new is the instrumentation. Local compute. Consent-governed data. Provenance on every claim. Technology that disappears into the room.

Who this is for: founders, researchers, technologists, and institutions that need trusted local AI workflows, explicit data governance, and durable intellectual memory.

What the institution produces:
- Instrument: open architecture specs, deployable local AI workflows, and practical system design patterns.
- Library: compounding ontologies, contributed datasets, and curated corpora that become more useful with use.
- Observatory: tested frameworks for agency, human-AI interaction, and institutional decision quality.

Seven layers of a single organism. The garden is on the roof. The hardware is in the basement.
