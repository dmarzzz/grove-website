An inter-organizational R&D hive mind — growing out of a former Catholic school and convent in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Engineers, researchers, artists, and organizers share a building. The Grove is what happens when they share infrastructure too.

Communities collide here — from privacy and AI to arts and civic action. The feedback loop between these groups and the idea space they occupy is the raw material. The Grove builds tools and software uniquely accelerated by this loop: local-first, private by default, data owned by the people who generate it.

The garden is on the roof. The hardware is in the basement.
