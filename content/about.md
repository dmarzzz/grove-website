An R&D movement born out of a decommissioned convent in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Researchers, builders, artists, and scientists share a building. The Grove is what happens when they share infrastructure too.

Communities collide here. From privacy and AI to arts and civic action. Everything built is used here first: the community is the test bed, not a market. The Grove builds tools and software uniquely accelerated by this feedback loop. Local-first, private by default, data owned by the people who generate it.
The garden is on the roof. The hardware is in the basement.
