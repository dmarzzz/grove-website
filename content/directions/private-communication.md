We participate in the construction and operation of nodes in anonymous broadcast networks — infrastructure that routes messages without exposing who sent them or where they land. In parallel, we explore nearby networking primitives — radio, mesh, optical, local-first protocols — as alternatives to routing everything through the open internet. The goal is communication that works even when the network is hostile.
