descriptor: Off the wire. Into the air.

We participate in the construction and operation of nodes in anonymous broadcast networks. Infrastructure that routes messages without exposing who sent them or where they land. In parallel, we explore nearby networking primitives: radio, mesh, optical, local-first protocols, as alternatives to routing everything through the open internet. The goal is communication that works even when the network is hostile.
