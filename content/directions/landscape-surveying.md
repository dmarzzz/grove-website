A systematic audit of local and open-source AI infrastructure: inference engines, model architectures, fine-tuning toolchains. We develop standardized benchmarks and evals to rank open-source language models against the specific workflows used at the school: transcription, knowledge linking, document analysis, local agent orchestration. The output is a practical donation map: where a dollar or an hour of work has maximum leverage, usable as input for various funding models such as deep funding.

→ Standardized benchmarks and evals for open-source LMs against school workflows
→ Practical donation guide for accelerating local AI infrastructure
→ Community meetups on local LLMs and personal AI assistants (Clowdbot++)
