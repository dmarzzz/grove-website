title: Sovereign AI Assessment
numeral: III
descriptor: Mapping the stack. Finding the leverage points.

A research survey of local and open-source AI infrastructure — inference engines, model architectures, fine-tuning toolchains — identifying where investment moves the needle most. The goal is a map of leverage: which layers of the stack are mature, which are fragile, where a dollar or an hour does the most to make sovereign compute practical for everyone.
