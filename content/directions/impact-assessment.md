descriptor: Mapping the stack. Finding the leverage points.

A systematic audit of local and open-source AI infrastructure — what runs in a browser tab, what needs a desktop GPU, what requires an external device. For each application in the library, the question is the same: what is the simplest, cheapest, most private model that actually works? The output is a compatibility matrix — runtime, hardware floor, model size, and privacy guarantees — so every workflow is as secure and efficient as the hardware allows.
