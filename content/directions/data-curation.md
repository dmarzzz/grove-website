title: The Living Library
numeral: II
descriptor: The shared body of knowledge. Not shelves of books, but a growing web of linked data.
---

As people use the collaboration tools, the library grows. Every conversation, transcript, and artifact feeds a shared knowledge corpus designed for consumption by both humans and agents. Psychomapping layers help contributors see their own reflection in the data: where thinking clusters, what gets avoided, how perspective shapes the whole. The data and context are what make everything else smarter.
