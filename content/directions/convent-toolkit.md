numeral: I
descriptor: A portable research kit. From conference to pop-up city to living room.
---

A portable toolkit for collaborative research. Record conversations, capture whiteboard sessions, and produce linked artifacts, all running locally on your own hardware. No remote servers, no cloud dependencies. You own the data, you control the inference. Take it to a conference, a pop-up city, or a living room and start generating knowledge immediately. The end goal of this direction: every AI primitive in the [Personal Operating System expected by 2030](https://docs.fileverse.io/document/dGgYcHjmuh9MbnkDP3owHp), running locally.

→ OS-agnostic application for local transcription, knowledge routing, and inference
→ Etherea: verbal and textual input to visual output pipeline
→ Embedded microphones in physical objects with explicit social contracts
