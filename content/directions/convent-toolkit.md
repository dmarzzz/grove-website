Transcription records every conversation with speaker diarization and real-time captioning. Camera Utilities captures whiteboards and documents. Summarization distills sessions into linked artifacts — action items, key decisions, linked references. Search indexes everything locally and retrieves across sessions. Conference to pop-up city to living room. No remote servers. You own the data.
